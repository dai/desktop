# :material-home: Welcome to Atuin Desktop

Transform your operational workflows from scattered terminal commands into powerful, collaborative runbooks that actually execute.

## What is Atuin Desktop?

Atuin Desktop bridges the gap between documentation and automation. Create **executable runbooks** that combine rich documentation with live database queries, API calls, scripts, and terminal sessions - all in a collaborative, block-based editor.

!!! info "Early Beta"
    We're still in early beta and things are changing fast! Your feedback helps shape the future of operational documentation.

## :material-lightning-bolt: Why Atuin Desktop?

**From Terminal to Team Workflow**  
Stop copy-pasting commands from docs. Build runbooks that execute database queries, run scripts, make API calls, and manage infrastructure - then share them with your team.

**Intuitive Block-Based Editor**  
Drag, drop, and rearrange content with a flexible editor designed specifically for operational workflows and automation.

**Real-time Collaboration**  
Work together on incident response, deployment procedures, and maintenance tasks with live editing and execution.
